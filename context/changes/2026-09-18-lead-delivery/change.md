## Notes

**This change has two homes.** The work does not fit in one repo, so the same `change.md` lives at
`context/changes/2026-09-18-lead-delivery/` in **both** `landing_26` and `wykonczymy`. It is one
change with one set of decisions; the copies are kept in step by hand, and a decision recorded on
one side is not agreed until it reads the same on the other.

`2026-09-17-s2-contact-form` in `landing_26` built the form and deliberately stopped short of a sink —
`submitContactForm` validates and returns `{ ok: true }` with the comment "No sink yet — where a
submission is delivered is the next change." This is that change.

A submission reaches the `leads` collection in the **leads app** (`/workspace/yolo/wykonczymy`) over
HTTP, with its attachments, and can be promoted by hand into an `investment`.

**Roadmap consequence: S2 and S6 merge.** The roadmap sequences S2 (form reaches the leads app) ahead
of S6 (photo attachments), but attachments shape the whole topology — a delivery path designed
without them is not one you extend, it is one you replace. S6's stated unblocking action
("agree the extended intake contract with the leads app") is what the 2026-09-18 design conversation
did; the decisions below are that agreement.

**The work straddles both repos, roughly half each.**

- **landing_26** — an address field on the form; a `submissions` queue collection; its own Blob
  store plus the token route that mints client upload tokens; the signed-JSON forward; retry via cron
  (`vercel.ts`, which this repo does not have yet); building `rawData`/`formQuestions` from the i18n
  dictionary; an orphan sweep for blobs whose submission never arrived.
- **wykonczymy** — `POST /api/webhooks/landing`; an assets upload collection; three new columns on
  `leads`; `landing_form` added to the `source` enum; an `investments.assets` relation (a migration
  on a collection guarded by `preventDeleteWithTransactions`); a `makePreventDelete` probe protecting
  an asset a live investment points at; the lead → investment promotion in `/zgloszenia`.

## Decisions

- **2026-09-18 — attachments are first-class.** Not a later slice. Files are the substance of an
  enquiry here: the hint copy already says "projekt, rzut, zdjęcia", and a renovation brief without
  the architect's PDF is not a brief. _(The rider "the contract is multipart from the start" is
  reversed below, 2026-09-21. First-class stands; the wire changed.)_

- **2026-09-18 — submissions land in `leads`; no `enquiries` collection.** The value on that side is
  the machinery around the collection, not the collection: `captureLead`'s store-then-notify, dedup
  on `(source, externalId)`, retry ×3, `notifyStatus` / `autoReplyStatus`, `/zgloszenia`,
  `leads-reconcile`, ~15 test files. `source` already discriminates. A second collection would need
  all of it duplicated or generalized, and would split the inbox a salesperson reads.

- **2026-09-18 — an enquiry becomes an investment by hand, never automatically.** `investments` is a
  heavy financial object: `guardInvestmentStatusUnlock` on `beforeChange`, `preventDeleteWithTransactions`
  on `beforeDelete`, coefficients, VAT, settlement mode, kosztorys. Auto-creating one per submission
  would fill it with spam that is deliberately hard to delete. Three states, not two: lead →
  qualification → investment, with the lead kept as provenance. Most leads never advance.

- **2026-09-18 — the typed field set is dictated by `investments`, not by the form.** A field earns a
  column when it feeds a promotion; everything else is read, not queried. That criterion immediately
  exposed a gap — `investments.address` has nothing to map from, so **the form gains an address
  field**. New columns on `leads`: `address`, `scope`, `area`, hidden for Facebook leads via
  `admin.condition`. `message` gets no column: long, never filtered, read in the answers dialog.

- **2026-09-18 — assets are generic; one upload collection serves both sides.** "Projekt" is a file
  kind (PDF, drawing, photo), not an entity. One collection shared by leads and investments means
  **promotion writes a relation and never copies bytes** — the file sits in Vercel Blob once. Two
  collections would re-upload on every promotion: double transfer, double storage, two copies free to
  drift.
  - Carries a known hazard this app has already hit once: the comment in `media.ts` records that
    `transactions_rels` is `ON DELETE cascade`, so deleting a media row silently unhooks it from every
    transfer pointing at it. Same shape here — deleting an old lead would take a PDF out from under a
    live investment. `makePreventDelete` (`@/hooks/prevent-delete`) already exists for exactly this.

- **2026-09-20 — that one collection IS `media`.** Reverses the 2026-09-18 rider "Not `media` — that
  is the invoice library under the 'Finanse' admin group". The objection was admin-panel labelling;
  the evidence against it is structural. Every layer of the upload path in `wykonczymy` is already
  generic and none of it mentions invoices: `process-upload-file` (classify → HEIC-convert →
  compress → size-guard), `POST /api/upload-file`, `uploadFile()`, `discardOrphanedUploads`, the
  `vercelBlobStorage` entry, the 400×300 thumbnail, and `media.mimeTypes` (`image/*`,
  `application/pdf`) — four unrelated surfaces already share it, including vehicle inspections and
  equipment handovers.
  - The decisive cost is not duplication, it is **`deleteUnreferencedMedia`**: a single reference
    counter naming, by hand, every collection that points at a file. It already lost that race —
    `equipment-events.attachments` was added later and is **not** counted, so those files are
    deletable out from under a live record **today**, despite the function's own comment instructing
    the next author to add it. A second collection means a second such counter. Instead, one registry
    (`MEDIA_RELATIONS`) drives both the counter and the `makePreventDelete` probes, and adding a
    relation is one line in one place.
  - Labelling is answered by a `kind` field (faktura / projekt / zdjęcie / inne) on `media`, which is
    cheaper than a collection and is the field the next decision below already calls for.

- **2026-09-18 — staff assign `kind`, at promotion; the visitor does not classify.** Every lead is
  qualified by hand anyway, and choosing which assets are worth carrying over is the same pass as
  saying what they are. A MIME-based guess at intake would be noise until a human looked regardless.
  `kind` is therefore not an intake field.

- **2026-09-18 — the outbox is a queue, not a second inbox.** Owner's call, against the advice
  recorded at the time: the cheaper option was inline retry plus an e-mail backstop (which is what
  the current WordPress site does, and this repo already has nodemailer + an SMTP adapter wired).
  Rejected because losing a lead is the outcome being bought out of. The cost — app-shaped machinery
  in a landing page — is contained by one rule: **a row lives until delivery, then is deleted.** Not
  housekeeping; it is what stops the queue becoming a shadow leads archive free to drift from the
  real one, and what keeps "one inbox" true. Hidden or read-only in the admin. Files are held only
  until delivery is confirmed; the canonical home stays the leads app's blob. With the 2026-09-21
  wire change the landing's store is also where the browser uploads to, so a blob can outlive a
  submission that was never completed — the same delete-on-delivery rule covers it, plus a sweep for
  uploads no queue row ever claimed.
  - Order is load-bearing, mirroring `captureLead`: **store → answer the visitor → forward.** The
    visitor's "thank you" rests on the local write, never on the other app answering.

- **2026-09-18 — typed core plus a self-describing tail; `source: 'landing_form'`.** Every field also
  rides in `rawData` + `formQuestions`, in the shape the leads app already parses — so
  `buildLeadAnswers` renders new questions in the answers dialog with **no migration and no deploy on
  that side**. That is the whole extensibility story; the duplication with the typed columns is
  deliberate (columns are for filtering and promotion, the tail is for reading). Labels come from the
  same i18n dictionary that rendered the form, so what is stored is the label the visitor actually
  saw; `locale` rides along. `landing_form` is a new `source` value so the cutover stays measurable
  while the WordPress form still runs, and so numeric WPForms `entry_id`s never share an `externalId`
  space with the landing's uuids.
  - Idempotency comes free: the landing mints a `submissionId` uuid at queue time and sends it as
    `externalId`, so a retry after a timeout that actually succeeded hits the unique index, returns
    `created: false`, and `captureLead` does not re-send the e-mails.

- **2026-09-18 — the wire schema is duplicated in both repos, pinned by a shared fixture.** Not a
  shared package (publish + version bump in two repos for every field) and not a copy script. Only
  the ~7-field envelope has to agree; the tail is self-describing. This follows the rule the leads
  app already states over `leadSchema` — strict on the envelope, permissive on what varies — with
  `notifyShapeAlert` as the existing safety net when a shape drifts.

- **2026-09-21 — the bytes never cross a function; the wire is signed JSON carrying blob URLs.**
  Reverses "the contract is multipart from the start". **The Vercel request-body cap is 4.5 MB on
  every function** — Server Action, Route Handler and middleware alike — returned as a 413
  `FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` by the platform before any of our code runs, so it cannot be caught,
  raised or configured away. Verified 2026-09-20 against the live
  `vercel.com/docs/functions/limitations`; `wykonczymy`'s `next.config.ts` already said so in a
  comment. A multipart push of 15 × 8 MB is ~13× over that, at **both** hops. The topology instead:
  1. The browser uploads each file **straight to the landing's Blob store** with a short-lived
     client token — the bytes never enter a function, so the cap never applies.
  2. The landing queues the submission with the resulting URLs and forwards **JSON** —
     HMAC-signed, a few kB.
  3. `wykonczymy` **fetches** each URL server-side into `media`. The cap governs what a function
     _receives_, never what it _fetches_; an outbound fetch is bounded only by duration and memory.

  Two consequences worth naming. It dissolves the multipart hazards that prompted the verification —
  JSON means `request.text()` is safe and `verifySignature` needs no change, making `wpforms/route.ts`
  a near-exact template. And it introduces one new risk in exchange: the webhook now resolves URLs
  another service supplies, so **SSRF** is guarded by an exact `URL.hostname` allowlist, `https:`
  only, and `redirect: 'error'` — a redirect off the allowlisted host is the bypass.
  - **Why the 4.5 MB number is not survivable by shrinking the limit:** `processUploadFile` skips
    compression for anything that is not an image, so a 4 MB ceiling rejects precisely the
    multi-page scans and designer decks this change calls the substance of an enquiry, while photos
    — which compress to ~128 KB — would never have noticed. EX-457's own manual checks put a 47 MB
    JPEG and a 45 MB HEIC through that guard and both passed; only PDFs have ever tripped it.
  - Ceilings move to the storage layer, where they refuse an upload before it exists: 15 assets,
    8 MB each, `allowedContentTypes` images + PDF, all enforced in `onBeforeGenerateToken`.

- **2026-09-21 — the visitor fills the form before a single byte is stored.** A public marketing
  form has no user to authenticate, so the gate is form validity: the token route runs the **same
  zod schema, server-side**, over the submitted fields carried in `clientPayload`, and mints an
  upload token only if it passes. A bot must therefore produce a complete, valid enquiry before it
  can touch storage, and rate limiting is defence in depth rather than the only wall. The cost is a
  deliberate UX order — the file picker uploads on submit, not on pick.

- **2026-09-21 — one agent edits both repos; `landing_26`'s read-only rule is lifted for this
  change.** Owner's call, granted in full: option (a)/(c) of the open question below. The rule
  ("nothing outside `landing_26` is ever edited", `AGENTS.md:21`) describes the reference repos it
  was written for — `nomad_chef`, `tdg` and the rest are sources to copy FROM. `wykonczymy` is not
  one of those: it is the other half of this change, and the two halves are agreed by a wire
  contract that cannot be kept in step from one side. `landing_26`'s `AGENTS.md` gets the carve-out
  written down — the sink repo is a write target for `lead-delivery`, the four reference repos stay
  read-only.

- **2026-09-21 — Open Question 5 is closed; there is no third delivery channel.** Owner's ruling:
  the notification recipients are the ones built here (the `notification-recipients` global), and
  nowhere else. The question only ever had force at cutover, and only about recipients — the WP form
  itself dies with the old site, so no submission path survives to be preserved. Nothing to confirm
  on the WordPress install.

- **2026-09-21 — lead uploads live under a `leads/<submissionId>/` prefix, and only that prefix is
  disposable.** Corrects the earlier shorthand that "the landing's Blob store is temporary". It is
  not: `scripts/blob-upload.ts` puts this site's own CMS media at the **store root**, calling `put`
  with `addRandomSuffix: false` and `allowOverwrite: true` because Payload's Blob adapter resolves
  `<store>/<filename>`, so the store holds permanent content alongside the transient uploads. The
  prefix is what separates them, and every cleanup rule below is scoped to it — nothing ever sweeps
  the store as a whole, and nothing is ever deleted by age alone at the root.

- **2026-09-21 — the client upload token is scoped to the prefix, not just to the file.**
  `onBeforeGenerateToken` pins `pathname` to `leads/<submissionId>/`, alongside the
  `allowedContentTypes` (images + PDF) and the 8 MB ceiling already decided above. Scoping matters
  because the root uses exact filenames with `allowOverwrite: true`: without the prefix pin, an
  anonymous visitor holding a valid token could name their upload after a CMS image and replace it.
  With it, an anonymous upload **structurally cannot** address the root — the guarantee is in the
  token, not in our validation.

- **2026-09-21 — the blob is deleted on confirmed delivery, by a callback carrying only the
  `submissionId`.** The canonical copy is the one `wykonczymy` fetched into `media`; the landing's
  copy is a staging area whose whole life is "until the other side has it". So `wykonczymy`, once its
  `payload.update` has **committed** the attach on the lead (the point after which the media rows are
  actually referenced — not merely after the fetch succeeded), POSTs back `{ submissionId }`, signed
  with the same HMAC secret and the same scheme as the inbound webhook. The landing lists
  `leads/<submissionId>/` and deletes what it finds.
  - **The callback carries no URLs.** A delete instruction that names its own targets is a delete
    primitive exposed to whoever can forge or replay it; one that names a submission can only ever
    destroy the files of a submission that was already delivered. The landing re-derives the target
    list from its own prefix, so the blast radius is bounded by the prefix scheme rather than by the
    caller's honesty.
  - **Partial deliveries are not cleaned up.** A file that landed in `failed[]` is one the leads app
    does _not_ have, so its bytes are the only copy left — the sweep below will not take it either,
    because it belongs to a submission that was delivered. It is deleted by hand once the failure is
    understood.
  - **The callback is non-fatal on both ends.** `wykonczymy` catches and logs it and still answers
    200 — the lead is already stored and the assets already attached, so a landing that is down must
    not turn a delivered submission into a retried one. The cost of a missed callback is an orphan
    the sweep picks up.

- **2026-09-21 — a prefix-scoped age sweep is the backstop, and it is the only thing that can see an
  abandoned upload.** A visitor who uploads and then closes the tab produces bytes no queue row ever
  claimed and no callback will ever mention, so delivery-driven cleanup is structurally blind to
  them. The sweep lists `leads/` only, and deletes a prefix whose objects are older than a fixed
  window **and** whose `submissionId` matches no live queue row. Two independent conditions on
  purpose: age alone would race a submission still retrying, and the queue check alone cannot see a
  submission that was never created.

- **2026-09-21 — rejected: `wykonczymy` holding a read-write token for the landing's store.** It is
  the shorter path — delete the source right after the fetch, no callback, no second endpoint — and
  it is rejected on blast radius. That token addresses the **whole** store, CMS media included, from
  a codebase whose own rules already treat a production Blob token as a hazard ("the production
  Vercel Blob store belongs to production only", `AGENTS.md`), and it would hand the leads app the
  power to destroy this site's images to save one HTTP call. The landing deletes its own bytes; no
  other service gets credentials to this store.

- **2026-09-21 — rejected: the browser uploading straight into `wykonczymy`'s store.** It looks like
  it removes the whole problem — one copy, no cleanup, no callback — and it does not. Three reasons,
  in order of weight:
  1. **It relocates the orphans rather than removing them.** An abandoned upload still happens; it
     now happens inside the store that holds invoices, where an age sweep is a far more dangerous
     instrument than it is under `leads/`.
  2. **It couples the marketing form to the leads app's availability.** Today a delivery outage costs
     a retry from the queue and the visitor sees nothing; with a token minted by `wykonczymy`, the
     visitor cannot even attach a file while that app is down — the outage moves from our outbox to
     the public form.
  3. **The completion signal is not reliable in development.** `onUploadCompleted` does not fire
     against localhost (no public URL for the callback), so the one hook that would tell `wykonczymy`
     a file exists is exactly the hook that cannot be exercised while building the feature.

  The fetch-side topology has none of these: the landing owns its own store, its own token route and
  its own cleanup, and the leads app only ever pulls.

- **2026-09-21 — one Blob store for every environment, so the sweep runs only from production.**
  There is no per-environment landing store: Preview and Production both resolve to
  `y06paq7r8hjnw5wb.public.blob.vercel-storage.com`, which is why `LANDING_BLOB_HOST` carries the
  same value in both. That makes `leads/` a **shared** prefix — a preview deploy and production write
  their staging uploads side by side, and neither can tell the other's apart by path. The
  delete-on-delivery callback is unaffected (it names a `submissionId`, and a submission belongs to
  exactly one deploy), but the **age sweep is not**: run from preview it would list production's
  `leads/` and delete files belonging to submissions still retrying on the other side. So the sweep
  is gated on `VERCEL_ENV === 'production'` and is declared as one cron, on production only — the
  same shape as the Sheets write credential and the Blob token gates in `wykonczymy`, and for the
  same reason: the environments differ in _code_, never in the resource they point at.

- **2026-09-20 — `area` is text.** Closes the open question. The label "Powierzchnia prac, np.
  30–60 m²" invites a range, which no numeric column holds; sorting on it was never asked for.

- **2026-09-21 — `locale` is dropped from the wire.** Reverses the rider in the 2026-09-18 "typed
  core plus a self-describing tail" decision that "`locale` rides along". Owner's call. The labels
  the visitor actually saw already travel in `formQuestions`, so nothing about reading the enquiry
  is lost; what is given up is the one field that says which language version produced the lead.
  `landingSubmissionSchema` already has `locale` as optional, so an unsent field needs no change on
  the receiving side — but the contract's envelope table, the shared fixture and this repo's builder
  must all stop listing it as something the landing sends.
  - **Consequence, so it is a choice and not an accident.** A lead from `/en/` is no longer
    distinguishable from a Polish one at a glance. And because the Server Action has no locale of
    its own, dropping the field means the question labels in `formQuestions` are rendered from the
    **default (Polish) dictionary** for every visitor — not the labels the English visitor actually
    saw, which the 2026-09-18 decision had called for. That is arguably the better outcome, since
    the person reading the answers dialog is a Polish salesperson, but it is a reversal and not a
    side effect.

- **2026-09-21 — the queue is visible but read-only in the admin.** Closes the "hidden or read-only"
  alternative left open by the 2026-09-18 outbox decision. A row stuck retrying is the one failure
  that has no other surface, and there is exactly one admin here. No create, update or delete
  through the UI: hand-editing a queue row could produce a delivery the leads app never dedupes, and
  the delete-on-delivery lifecycle owns the row's death.

- **2026-09-21 — rate limiting is Vercel Firewall, not a package.** `change.md` called rate limiting
  "defence in depth" without naming a mechanism. Platform rules on the two public paths need no
  dependency and no second store, which is what a landing page should cost. The tradeoff is that the
  rules live in Vercel's config rather than the repo, so they are a manual check, not a test.

## Build status — 2026-09-21

Written down because "the env vars are set and the deploy is green" was read once as "the feature is
ready", and it is not the same claim. The deployment plane and the feature plane are listed apart on
purpose.

**On `wykonczymy`, built and on staging** (`dace70ce`, deploy `wykonczymy-ew3ujwrl4`, typecheck clean,
14 route specs + 5 callback specs green):

- `POST /api/webhooks/landing` — signature (403), envelope (400), `captureLead` (the only step
  allowed to 500), serial asset fetch, attach, redelivery guard.
- `signBody()` in `verify-signature.ts` — one signer for both directions, so the inbound verify and
  the outbound sign cannot drift apart. **Scoped since 2026-09-21:** the key is
  `HMAC(LANDING_WEBHOOK_SECRET, scope)`, `landing-submission` inbound and `landing-cleanup`
  outbound, so a captured submission signature is not also a valid delete instruction (Meta's
  `x-hub-signature-256` stays on the bare app secret). **The landing must sign and verify the same
  way** — mirrored into `src/lib/contact/sign.ts` there, and specified in the shared contract doc.
- `releaseLandingAssets()` — the delete-on-delivery callback. Fires only when the number of files we
  hold equals the number the envelope listed — counted, not inferred from an empty `failed[]` — and
  only once the attach write has committed. Never throws, and runs behind `after()`, so a landing
  that is down cannot turn a delivered submission into a retried one.
- `LANDING_CLEANUP_URL` — optional in the schema. Absent means the callback is skipped and the
  webhook still answers `200`; the cost is an orphaned prefix the landing's sweep reclaims.
- `LANDING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `LANDING_BLOB_HOST` are set on both projects × both environments, one
  shared value each. This staging build is the **first one baked with the re-created secret**, so a
  signed POST from the landing is now what proves the two sides actually match — nothing before it
  did.

**On `landing_26`, unbuilt.** `submitContactForm` still ends at "No sink yet". Missing: the
`submissions` queue collection, the token route with prefix pinning, the signed forward, the cleanup
receiver, the age sweep.

**Blocking an end-to-end test, and none of it is the agent's to do:**

1. **Protection Bypass for Automation** — the wykonczymy project has none (`protectionBypass = None`,
   read off the projects API; it is per-project, so nothing is inherited team-wide). Until the owner
   mints one in Settings → Deployment Protection, a POST to the staging preview URL is answered `401`
   before it ever reaches the route, and the landing must then send it as `x-vercel-protection-bypass`.
2. **`EMAIL_HOST` on wykonczymy Preview** — `vercel env pull` returns it empty because it is
   sensitive, so its value is **unknown**, not verified. If it is the real SMTP host rather than
   `disabled.invalid`, a test lead mails real employees: `notification-recipients` is a Payload global,
   so it lives in the DB, and every non-production DB here is a restored prod dump. Read it in the
   dashboard before firing anything.
3. **`LANDING_CLEANUP_URL`** — deliberately not set yet. Add it once the landing's receiver exists.
