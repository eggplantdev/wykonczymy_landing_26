# Landing intake contract

The one artifact both repos read. `landing_26` sends; `wykonczymy` receives at
`POST /api/webhooks/landing`. The contract is **duplicated, not packaged** (decision, 2026-09-18) —
so this file and the fixture beside it are what keep the two copies from drifting silently.

A byte-identical copy of this file lives in `landing_26`. Change one, change both.

## Endpoint

```
POST https://<wykonczymy>/api/webhooks/landing
Content-Type: application/json
x-landing-signature: sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256 of the RAW body, under the scoped key below>
```

The HMAC is computed over the **exact bytes sent**, never over a re-serialised object — a
re-`JSON.stringify` on either side changes key order or spacing and the signature stops matching.
Shared secret: `LANDING_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, the same value in both projects' env.

**The key is scoped, not the bare secret.** Each direction signs with a key derived from the shared
secret and a scope string:

```
key   = HMAC-SHA256(LANDING_WEBHOOK_SECRET, <scope>)      # scope as utf-8 bytes
value = "sha256=" + hex(HMAC-SHA256(key, <raw body>))
```

| Direction                         | Scope                |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| landing → wykonczymy (submission) | `landing-submission` |
| wykonczymy → landing (cleanup)    | `landing-cleanup`    |

One undifferentiated key would make the two interchangeable, and that is not theoretical: a cleanup
body is nothing but a `submissionId`, and every submission envelope carries one — so a signed
submission, of which the landing's own retry queue holds copies, would also be a valid and
never-expiring „delete this submission's files" instruction. Scoping also makes the signature layer
refuse a request either side sends to the wrong endpoint, which it otherwise waves through.

## Envelope

Strict on what identifies a submission, permissive on the rest: the landing may add a question
without a coordinated deploy here, and an unknown field is ignored rather than rejected.

| Field                                 | Required | Notes                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `submissionId`                        | yes      | uuid, one per submission — this is what makes a replay idempotent                     |
| `submittedAt`                         | no       | ISO 8601                                                                              |
| `formId`, `formName`                  | no       | recorded as-is                                                                        |
| `name`, `email`, `phone`              | no       | the standard three                                                                    |
| `address`, `scope`, `area`, `timing`, `message` | no | the landing's typed answers; `area` and `timing` are text, because the form invites a range ("30–60 m²", "jak najszybciej") |
| `rawData`                             | no       | `{ name, values[] }[]` — when omitted, the typed answers above become the answer list |
| `formQuestions`                       | no       | `{ key, label, type? }[]` — key→label for the answers modal                           |
| `assets`                              | no       | `{ url, filename, contentType, size }[]`, at most **15**                              |

Schema and mapping: `src/lib/leads/landing.ts`. Fixture: `src/__tests__/fixtures/landing-submission.ts`.

## Files

The bytes never travel in this request. The visitor uploads straight to the landing's own blob
store, and this handler pulls each file back from its url.

- `url` must be `https:` and its **hostname must equal `LANDING_BLOB_HOST`** exactly. A redirect is
  refused rather than followed — a redirect off the allowlisted host is the bypass the allowlist
  exists to stop.
- Accepted types mirror `media.mimeTypes`: `image/*`, `application/pdf`. Checked on the declared
  `contentType` **and** on the response's.
- Ceiling: **8 MB** per file, enforced on `size`, on `content-length`, and by counting bytes as the
  body streams — the first two are the sender's claims, the third is the fact.

There is **one landing Blob store for every environment** — Preview and Production resolve to the
same host, so `LANDING_BLOB_HOST` carries the same value in both. The consequence is that `leads/`
is a _shared_ prefix: a preview deploy and production stage their uploads side by side and neither
can tell the other's apart by path. Delivery-driven cleanup is unaffected (it names a
`submissionId`, which belongs to exactly one deploy), but anything that deletes by age must run
from production only.

## Callback: delete on confirmed delivery

The landing's copy of a file is staging; the canonical copy is the one this app fetched into
`media`. So once the attach has **committed** — after the `payload.update` that points the lead at
its media rows, not merely after the fetch succeeded — `wykonczymy` tells the landing it may drop
its bytes.

```
POST <LANDING_CLEANUP_URL>
Content-Type: application/json
x-landing-signature: sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256 of the RAW body, scope `landing-cleanup`>

{ "submissionId": "<uuid>" }
```

Same secret and same scheme as the inbound webhook (`LANDING_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, HMAC over the exact
bytes sent) but under scope **`landing-cleanup`**, so an inbound submission's signature is not one
of these. `LANDING_CLEANUP_URL` is the full endpoint url, held in `wykonczymy`'s env.

**The callback carries no urls.** A delete instruction that names its own targets is a delete
primitive exposed to whoever can forge or replay it; one that names a submission can only ever
destroy the files of a submission that was already delivered. The landing re-derives the target
list by listing its own `leads/<submissionId>/` prefix, so the blast radius is bounded by the
prefix scheme rather than by the caller's honesty.

**It is non-fatal on both ends.** `wykonczymy` catches and logs a failed callback and still answers
`200` to the original webhook — the lead is stored and the assets are attached, so a landing that is
down must not turn a delivered submission into a retried one. The cost of a missed callback is an
orphan, which the landing's age sweep reclaims.

| Situation                                         | Status | What happens                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bad or missing signature                          | `403`  | nothing is deleted                                     |
| Body is not JSON, or `submissionId` is not a uuid | `400`  | —                                                      |
| Prefix listed and deleted                         | `200`  | the queue row's files are gone                         |
| No such prefix, or already deleted                | `200`  | idempotent — a replay deletes nothing twice            |
| The delete itself failed                          | `500`  | the sweep is the backstop; `wykonczymy` does not retry |

**Partial deliveries are not cleaned up by the callback, and the sweep is a deadline, not a
reprieve.** A file that landed in `failed[]` is one this app does _not_ have, so its bytes are the
only copy left — which is why the callback never fires for that submission. But the sweep cannot
tell that prefix from an abandoned one: the submission WAS delivered, so its queue row is gone, and
once the age window passes the sweep's two conditions (old enough, no live queue row) both hold and
it reclaims the files. So `notifyAssetFailure`'s e-mail carries an implicit expiry — the failure has
to be dealt with inside the sweep window, by hand, or the last copy goes with it.

**The callback is counted, not inferred.** `wykonczymy` releases a submission only when the number
of files it holds equals the number the envelope listed. An empty `failed[]` is not that claim: on a
redelivery the download loop never runs, so nothing fails because nothing is attempted — and the
pass that did run may have dropped a file. Counting also makes a lost `200` cheap: a redelivery
whose first pass was complete still adds up, so it re-sends the callback rather than leaving an
orphaned prefix behind.

## Two rules that live on the landing side

1. **The upload token is minted only after the form validates server-side.** Otherwise the store is
   an open file drop.
2. **The blob host must be the one wykonczymy allowlists** — the same single value in every
   environment.

| Some files could not be pulled      | `200`  | **the lead is stored** with what resolved; ops alert lists the failed urls |
| Same `submissionId` again           | `200`  | no second lead, no second e-mail, no second download                       |
| The lead itself could not be stored | `500`  | the landing should retry                                                   |

`200` means „stop retrying", so it is the answer to everything except a failure to store the lead.
Losing the enquiry is the outcome the landing's queue exists to prevent; an incomplete photo set is
the lesser failure, and the alert makes it visible. Recovery is real, not theoretical: a failed
file's url stays live in the landing's store until its queue row is deleted, so the alert carries
the url and the file can be attached by hand.
