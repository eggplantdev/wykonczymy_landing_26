/**
 * The envelope both repos agree on, pinned by one fixture committed byte-identically here and in
 * `wykonczymy`. The contract is duplicated rather than packaged (recorded 2026-09-18 decision), so
 * this file is what stops the two copies drifting silently — a sender-side change that breaks it
 * breaks a test on both sides.
 *
 * The receiving copy annotates this with `LandingSubmissionT` from its own envelope schema; this
 * side pins it against the builder's own return type, so a field the builder stops sending is a
 * compile error here rather than a silent wire change. The self-describing tail is omitted: it is
 * derived from the same answers and carries no agreement the typed fields do not.
 *
 * All PII is fabricated.
